          <h2>The Story of "Runaway"</h2>
          <p>
            "Runaway" is a 35-minute movie directed by Kanye West, which
            showcases his artistic vision and creativity. The film features a
            mix of visuals and narrative that correlate with the album's themes.
            The movie is about a phoenix that falls from the sky and meets a
            woman. The woman is initially frightened by the phoenix but later
            becomes friends with it. The phoenix is then taken to a group of
            people, but they do not accept it because of its difference. The
            phoenix eventually flies away, but not before setting itself on
            fire, symbolizing the sacrifice of artistic expression in a society
            that rejects it.
